## Milestone 3 (Friday 3rd June, 5pm) 
80% of the final grade
For the final milestone, you need to create a cool, interactive, and sufficiently complex D3.js (and other) data viz on the dataset you chose. Tell a data story and explain it to the targeted audience. Create a process book that details how you got there, from the original idea to the final product.
You need to deliver the following things:
### Github repository with a README
* Host the code and data on Github (if data is too big, link to a cloud
storage) with your process book as a PDF file
* Add a README file that explains the technical setup and intended usage
* Code should be clean, manageable, and using the latest practices
### Screencast
* Demonstrate what you can do with your viz in a fun, engaging and
impactful manner
* Talk about your main contributions rather than on technical details o 2 min video (not more)
### Processbook(max8pages)
* Describe the path you took to obtain the final result
* Explain challenges that you faced and design decisions that you took 
* Reuse the sketches/plans that you made for the first milestone, expanding them and explaining the changes
* Care about the visual/design of this report
* Peer assessment: include a breakdown of the parts of the project completed by each team member.

**The grading is the following:**
* Visualization (35%)
* Technical Implementation (15%)
* Screencast (25%)
* Process book (25%)

**Grades may vary across the team members, based on the process book and the peer assessment process. Please provide clear explanations.**

**Late policy**
  
* < 24h: 80% of the grade for the milestone
* < 48h: 70% of the grade for the milestone
